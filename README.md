As players of one of the more fast-paced and injury-prone sports, the careers of NBA players can
take unpredictable turns. However, success does not happen by chance; players cultivate funda-
mental skills over the course of their careers. Can statistics from a player’s first season tell us
anything about their career longevity? This analysis will assess that question, quantifying first-
year performance and career longevity with rookie season statistics and whether the player lasts
at least five years in the league. Our inferential study seeks to provide a better understanding
of how rookie performance relates to career longevity in the NBA, and our findings could help
coaches and fans recognize valuable player metrics early on in players’ careers.
